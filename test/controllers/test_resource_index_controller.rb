# WARNING
#
# This class does not test much. There is full test coverage for Resource Index in the http://github.com/ncbo/resource_index project.
# What happens here is that we stub the methods from the Resource Index project so that they always return known JSON.
# This JSON is stored in the constants below (RESOURCES, COUNTS, etc). This means that if the output of the Resource Index API
# changes, these tests will not fail. We would need to get the new JSON from the modified code and replace what is here.
# However, these tests do cover some basic functionality like 404 responses and that the JSON ouput isn't mangled by the serializer.

Techniques range from wide field mosaics taken with multiphoton microscopy to 3D reconstructions of cellular ultrastructure using electron tomography. Contributions from the community are welcome. The CCDB was designed around the process of reconstruction from 2D micrographs, capturing key steps in the process from experiment to analysis. The CCDB refers to the set of images taken from the as the Microscopy Product. The microscopy product refers to a set of related 2D images taken by light (epifluorescence, transmitted light, confocal or multiphoton) or electron microscopy (conventional or high voltage transmission electron microscopy). These image sets may comprise a tilt series, optical section series, through focus series, serial sections, mosaics, time series or a set of survey sections taken in a single microscopy session that are not related in any systematic way. A given set of data may be more than one product, for example, it is possible for a set of images to be both a mosaic and a tilt series. The Microscopy Product ID serves as the accession number for the CCDB. All microscopy products must belong to a project and be stored along with key specimen preparation details. Each project receives a unique Project ID that groups together related microscopy products. Many of the datasets come from published literature, but publication is not a prerequisite for inclusion in the CCDB. Any datasets that are of high quality and interest to the scientific community can be included in the CCDB. The goal of the CCDB project is to make unique and valuable datasets available to the scientific community for visualization, reuse and reanalysis. Data in the CCDB can be accessed by performing a Search or by browsing through our Gallery. Data in the CCDB may be downloaded freely and reused for non-profit use within the terms of our usage agreement.","logo":"http://neurolex.org/w/images/a/a4/Ccdb.jpg","count":431,"updated":"2012-06-26 04:06:46 -0700","completed":"2013-09-26 00:03:44 -0700","fields":{"CCDB_CellType":{"name":"CellType","ontology":null,"weight":0.9},"CCDB_ProjectName":{"name":"ProjectName","ontology":null,"weight":1.0},"CCDB_Microscope_Type":{"name":"Microscope_Type","ontology":null,"weight":0.5},"CCDB_Age":{"name":"Age","ontology":null,"weight":0.5},"CCDB_Region":{"name":"Region","ontology":null,"weight":0.9},"CCDB_Species":{"name":"Species","ontology":null,"weight":0.8}}},{"name":"CellImageLibrary (via NIF)","acronym":"CIL","mainField":"CIL_Image_description","homepage":"http://cellimages.ascb.org/","lookupURL":"http://cellimagelibrary.org/images/","description":"The Cell an Image Library is a freely accessible, easy-to-search, public repository of vetted and annotated images, videos, and animations of cells from a variety of organisms, showcasing cell architecture, intracellular functionalities, and both normal and abnormal processes.","logo":"http://neurolex.org/w/images/1/17/The_Cell_-_an_image_library.PNG","count":4282,"updated":"2014-03-24 02:46:11 -0700","completed":"2014-03-24 03:07:30 -0700","fields":{"CIL_CellType":{"name":"CellType","ontology":null,"weight":0.0},"CIL_CellLine":{"name":"CellLine","ontology":null,"weight":0.0},"CIL_Image_description":{"name":"Image_description","ontology":null,"weight":1.0},"CIL_Cellular_component":{"name":"Cellular_component","ontology":null,"weight":0.9},"CIL_Organism":{"name":"Organism","ontology":null,"weight":0.5},"CIL_Investigator_name":{"name":"Investigator_name","ontology":null,"weight":0.7}}},{"name":"ClinicalTrials.gov","acronym":"CT","mainField":"CT_brief_title","homepage":"http://clinicaltrials.gov/","lookupURL":"http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/","description":"ClinicalTrials.gov provides regularly updated information about federally and privately supported clinical research in human volunteers.

The model source code doesn't even have to reside inside ModelDB; it just has to be available from some publicly accessible online repository or WWW site. ModelDB is curated in order to maximize the scientific utility of its contents. The ideal model entry would contain \"original\" (author-written) source code, especially if it works and reproduces at least one figure from a published article. Original source code has tremendous value because it is what the authors used to generate the simulation results from which they derived their published insights and conclusions.

Midgut invasion is a major bottleneck for Plasmodium development inside the mosquito vectors as a rapidly responding immune system recognizes ookinetes and recruits killing factors from the midgut and surrounding tissues, dramatically reducing the population of invading ookinetes before they can successfully traverse the midgut epithelium. Understanding molecular details of the parasite-vector interactions requires precise measurement of nascent protein synthesis in the mosquito during Plasmodium infection. Current expression profiling primarily monitors alterations in steady-state levels of mRNA, but does not address the equally critical issue of whether the proteins encoded by the mRNAs are actually synthesized. In this study, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation to isolate actively translating Anopheles gambiae mRNAs based upon their association with polyribosomes (polysomes). The proportion of individual gene transcripts associated with polysomes, which is determined by RNA deep sequencing, reflects mRNA translational status. This approach led to identification of 1017 mosquito transcripts that were primarily regulated at the translational level after ingestion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood. Caspar, a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB transcription factor Rel2, appears to be substantially activated at the translational levels during Plasmodium infection. In addition, transcripts of Dcr1, Dcr2 and Drosha, which are involved in small RNA biosynthesis, exhibited enhanced associations with polysomes after P. falciparum challenge. This observation suggests that mosquito microRNAs may play an important role in reactions against Plasmodium invasion. We analyzed both total cellular mRNAs and mRNAs that are associated with polysomes to simultaneously monitor transcriptomes and nascent protein synthesis in the mosquito. This approach provides more accurate information regarding the rate of protein synthesis, and identifies some mosquito factors that might have gone unrecognized because expression of these proteins is regulated mainly at the translational level rather than at the transcriptional level after mosquitoes ingest a Plasmodium-infected blood meal. Midguts from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were dissected at around 24 h after ingestion of P. falciparum-infected blood. Mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood were used as control. A portion of the midguts were used for isolation of total cellular RNA. Extracts of the remaining midguts were fractionated over sucrose density gradients, and fifteen fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. Non-polysomal fractions, as well as polysomal fractions were combined, respectively, to obtain two RNA pools per gradient for three independent experiments. The first, last and the sample between non-polysomal and polysomal, were all discarded to ensure pure pools from each set. A fourth experiment was conducted where the polysomal and non-polysomal samples were not pooled, to be used later for qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels of individual mosquito genes in polysome (PS) fractions, nonpolysome (NP) fractions and unfractionated steady-state (total) RNA were determined using high throughput RNA deep sequencing. Each RNA pool generated 2.1-9.8 million raw read .  Signal intensities of transcripts from each PS pool were compared to those of transcripts from a matching NP pool. To quantify the translational status of individual mRNA species, we define the relative PS loading [PL=P/(P+NP)] as the extent of mRNA association with polysomes. PL values were compared between the mosquitoes fed on P. falciparum-infected or -uninfected blood.","AE_experiment_type":"EFO\u001fhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0003738","AE_species":"NCBITAXON\u001fhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_7165","AE_name":"Translational regulation of Anopheles gambiae mRNAs in the midgut during Plasmodium falciparum infection"},{"AE_description":"RNA helicase A (RHA) binds its target transcripts at the post-transcriptional control element (PCE) located in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR).

Detectable concentrations of DES in effluent and surface waters have been reported to range from slightly below 1 to greater than 10 ng/L.  Little is known, however, concerning the toxicological potency of DES in fish.  In this study, sexually-mature fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) of both sexes were exposed to 1, 10 or 100 ng DES/L water in a flow-through system.  Tissue concentrations of DES and changes in a number of estrogen-responsive endpoints, including alterations to the hepatic transcriptome in females, were measured in the fish at the end of a 4-d exposure, and after a 4-d depuration/recovery period in clean water. The objectives of the study were to measure accumulation of DES in fish tissues, characterize effects of the chemical on physiological endpoints related to reproductive performance, and to evaluate DES's potency relative to concentrations reported in aquatic environments. The current series includes n=12 microarrays associated with exposure-phase samples (collected from fish exposed continuously for 4 d). Fish were exposed to 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng DES/L delivered in a continuous flow (45 ml/min) of sand filtered, UV treated, Lake Superior Water, without the use of carrier solvents. Flow of DES into the test system was initiated without fish present and continued for 1 d.  Exposures then were started by placing three male and three female sexually-mature fathead minnows into each tank. There were eight replicate tanks for the control and 100 ng/L treatments, and six replicate tanks for the 1 and 10 ng/L groups.  The fish were held at 25+1ºC under a 16:8 L:D photoperiod and were fed frozen adult brine shrimp twice daily (San Francisco Bay Brand, Newark, CA, USA).  Fish used for the experiment were from an on-site culture, and all procedures involving animals conformed to guidelines approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee. After the 4-d exposure, fish from three tanks from each treatment (n=9 per sex) were sampled for determination of various biological endpoints.  At this time fish from two additional tanks from the control and 100 ng/L treatments also were sampled for determination of DES tissue residues (n=6 per sex).  Delivery of DES to the test system was subsequently stopped, and fish from the remaining three tanks per treatment group were sampled 4 d later (n= 9 per sex). The fathead minnows were euthanized with buffered MS-222 (Argent, Redmond, VA, USA) and weighed.  Fish were scored for occurrence and relative expression of nuptial tubercles, which in males can be reduced by ER agonists.  Blood was collected from the caudal vein/artery with a microhematocrit tube, and plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at -80ºC.  Gonads were removed from males and a subsample (8.5±3.0 mg; mean±SD) was immediately immersed in tissue culture media for determination of ex vivo steroid production. Livers were removed from both sexes and flash-frozen for gene expression analyses using microarray (females) or real-time QPCR (males). Hepatic transcripts from three females per treatment group, in each phase of the experiment (except n=2 from recovery phase 10 ng/L) were analyzed using a custom 15,000 feature microarray (GEO Platform Accession GPL9248).

These microarray data were generated to compare the expression levels of metabolic enzymes to the concentrations of their associated metabolites over the 48-hour life cycle. Sorbitol-synchronized Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 strain) was grown in tissue culture flasks in incubators according to standard protocols.  Immediately after reinvasion, and at 8-hour intervals thereafter, parasites were harvested by centrifugation.  For each timepoint, 0.5 mL of packed RBC (10% parasitemia) was pelleted by centrifugation, washed once in PBS and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Total RNA isolation and amino-allyl cDNA labeling were as previously described (Bozdech et al., 2003).  A pool of 3D7 total RNA from all intraerythrocytic developmental stages was generated and used as the reference sample.  For DNA microarray hybridization, pool cDNA was coupled to Cy3 dye, while cDNA from an individual timepoint was coupled to Cy5 dye.  DNA microarrays were scanned using an Axon 4200A scanner and images analyzed using Axon GenePix software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA).  Microarray data were stored and analyzed using our in-house database PUMAdb (Princeton University MicroArray database).

Experiment Overall Design: Cells were grown 24 h at 30 C in YEPD to a density of about 500,000,000 cells/ml. At harvest, sugar was found to be depleted as measured by an enzymatic dip stick (Diastic, Bayer). Cells were pelleted and washed twice in sterile distilled water by centrifugation and then diluted 10-fold into 100 ml of Flor medium (YNB + 4% ethanol + leucine + histidine + uracil) in triplicate 250 ml beakers. Cultures were then grown statically in Flor medium at 27 C. Within a few hours following inoculation, the bulk liquid appeared to be clear, no biofilm was evident by visual observation, and a layer of settled cells was evident at the bottom of the beakers. After 48 h, a visible air-liquid interfacial biofilm covered the entire surface while the thickness of the layer of settled cells appeared unchanged. After 48 h, biofilm cells (floaters) were collected by aseptic aspiration. Once the biofilm cells were removed, cells at the bottom of the beaker (sinkers) were collected similarly. Cells from both populations were washed once in sterile distilled water by centrifugation prior to RNA isolation. Significant cell clumping was evident in both populations of cells by microscopic observation. While cell viability was estimated by plating on YEPD, the resultant cfu/ml values could not be directly correlated with cell counts in a hemacytometer because clumps of cells containing at least one viable cell presumably produced only a single colony. Further, counting individual cells accurately in the numerous clumps containing large numbers of cells was not possible. Nonetheless, when cells were counted (clumps were counted as single cells) and compared to cfu/ml for the same suspension, the cfu/ml values were about 2-fold higher than the corresponding values for cell counts using the hemacytometer for both biofilm and bottom layer cells.","AE_experiment_type":"EFO\u001fhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0002768","AE_species":"NCBITAXON\u001fhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_4932","AE_name":"Transcription profiling of S. cerevisiaeAir-liquid interfacial biofilm vs planktonic S. cerevisiae cells"},{"AE_description":"Samples and RNA preparation: The series is composed of 4 hybridizations for analysis of differentially expressed genes in the liver of ciprofibrate dosed vs. control rats. Rats (200-250 g) were given (by gastric intubation) tap water (control group, n=5) or ciprofibrate (50 mg/kg body weight, once daily for 60 days, n=4). Liver total RNA extraction was performed first by ultracentrifugation on a cesium chloride cushion and then using TRIZOL Reagent (GIBCO BRL Life Technologies, New York, NY). Labeling and hybridization: One microgram of total RNA from the control pool (n=5), and from each ciprofibrate dosed rat was reverse transcribed and labeled with Cy3- and Cy5-attached dendrimer, respectively, using 3DNA Array Detection Submicro kit as described in the manufacturer's protocols  (Genisphere, Montvale, NJ).

To better define molecular subtypes of the disease, we performed SNP and gene expression profiling microarray analyses in a panel of early stage (Binet A) patients. A clustering analysis of genomic profiles identified four significant groups mainly driven by del(13)(q14) and trisomy 12. Notably, patients with del(13)(q14) were grouped in two separate clusters based on the presence of a biallelic loss and the extension of the deletion. The shorter monoallelic deleted 13q14 region was found to be 635 kb in length, not encompassing the mir-15a/16-1 locus. Interestingly, the mir-15a and mir-16 expression was found to be significantly down-regulated only in patients with biallelic loss. Furthermore, a multiclass supervised analysis identified a different transcriptional signatures in the two genomic subgroups with del(13)(q14). Finally, an integrative approach identified 93 transcripts, mainly mapped to chromosome 12 and 13q12-q14.3, whose expression was significantly correlated with the DNA copy number. Overall, our data further support the notion that transcription deregulation in B-CLL could be mostly due to a gene dosage effect and underscore the presence of two distinct molecular types of 13q14 deleted patients with potential clinical relevance. Transcriptional analysis of 60 B-CLL patients, and genotyping analysis of 100 B-CLL patients, in early stage disease (Binet A).  This series of microarray experiments contains the gene expression profiles of purified B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells obtained from 60 newly diagnosed patients (Binet stage A). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation and the proportion of CD5/CD19/CD23 triple positive B cells in the suspension was determined by direct immunofluorescence performed using a FACS-sort flow cytometer with antibodies to: CD19 FITC/PE, CD23 PE and CD5 Cy-Chrome. If B-CLL cells were less than 90%, T cells, NK cells and monocytes were removed by negative selection using CD3, CD56, CD16, and CD14 monoclonal antibody treatment followed by magnetic beads. 3 micrograms of total RNA was processed and, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols, 15 micrograms of fragmented biotin-labelled cRNA were hybridized on GeneChip Human Genome U133A Arrays (Affymetrix Inc.). The arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. The images were acquired using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4) and the probe level data converted to expression values using the Bioconductor function for the Robust Multi-Array average (RMA) procedure (Irizarry et al, 2003), in which perfect match intensities are background adjusted and quantile-quantile normalised.

Vitamin A and its derivatives (the retinoids) participate in many physiological processes including vision, cellular differentiation and reproduction. VAD affects spermatogenesis, the subject of our present study. Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process of differentiation and complex morphologic alterations that, in the postnatal testis, leads to the formation of sperm in the seminiferous epithelium. VAD causes early cessation of spermatogenesis, characterized by degeneration of meiotic germ cells, leading to seminiferous tubules containing mostly type A spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of VAD on spermatogenesis in mice. We used adult Balb/C mice fed with a Control or VAD diet for an extended period of time (8-28 weeks) and selected two time points (18 and 25 weeks) for microarray analysis.  To understand the effect of VAD on the spermatogonial stem cell transcriptome, we studied isolated pure populations of spermatogonia from control and vitamin-A-deficient mice from two representative time points (18 and 25 weeks) using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. We identified target genes involved in the arrest of spermatogonial differentiation and spermatogenesis. Our results establish a better understanding of the chronology and magnitude of the consequences of VAD on mouse testes and add to the current knowledge of the molecular regulatory mechanisms of germ cell development. Spermatogonia were isolated by the STATPUT procedure with minor modifications. VAD mice were sacrificed at 18 and 25 weeks of VAD treatment for spermatogonia isolation. Decapsulated testes from 2 mice were suspended in RPMI medium containing collagenase (0.6 mg/ml), Hyaluronidase (0.12 mg/ml) and DNAse I (1.25 mg/ml) and incubated at 37ºC for 30 minutes in a shaking water bath. The tissues were then allowed to come down the tube and the supernatant (containing interstitial cells) was removed. The pellet was incubated with 3 ml of 0.25% Trypsin /EDTA (GIBCO, Invitrogen, USA), in the presence of DNAse I (0.2 mg/ml) at 37ºC for 15 minutes in a shaking water bath. The dispersed cells were washed twice with RPMI medium containing 10% heat inactivated FBS to neutralize the protease activity, and filtered through a sterile 0.22 nylon to remove any undigested fragments. Cells of the dissociated seminiferous epithelium were then plated overnight in a 34ºC 3% CO2 incubator. The following day, germ cells, in suspension, were separated by sedimentation with use of a 2-4% BSA gradient. The cells were allowed to sediment for a standard period of 2.5 h, and fractions of 2-ml volume were collected. The cells of each fraction were examined under a phase contrast microscope, and fractions containing cells of similar size and morphology were pooled and spun down by low-speed centrifugation. Purity of spermatogonia was estimated and was routinely higher than 90%. Total RNA was extracted from the isolated germ cells using TRIzol ® Reagent, and cleaned with RNeasy minicolumns. RNA content was determined by measurement of optical density at 260 nm. Only the RNA samples showing an OD 260/280 ratio higher than 1.8 were used for microarray hybridization.

Design and Methods: We selected 7 patients with myeloid malignancies and small 12p deletions by FISH encompassing only the region centromeric of ETV6 and further evaluated them by SNP microarrays. Results: The minimal deleted region (MDR) contained nine genes only. These genes were subsequently analyzed by microarray expression profiling in an independent cohort of 781 cases mostly with different hematological malignancies or without any hematological malignancy: CREBL2, MANSC1, and CDKN1B were expressed in >25% of cases, while the other 6 genes were expressed in a minority of cases only. As CDKN1B is a cell cycle regulator and functions as a tumor suppressor gene, this gene was selected for further expression studies in 286 AML patients. In cases with low CDKN1B expression (expression level <1,160; 1st quartile), RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (11/83; 13.3%; vs. 5/203; 2.5%; p=0.001), PML-RARA rearrangements (11/83; 13.3%; vs. 4/203; 2.0%; p<0.001), 11q23/MLL rearrangements (6/83; 7.2%; vs. 4/203; 2.0%; p=0.038), and FLT3-TKD mutations (7/63; 11.1% vs. 6/167; 3.6%; p=0.047) were more frequently observed than in patients with intermediate/high expression (2nd-4th quartiles).

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) exhibit partial estrogen agonist/antagonist activity in estrogen target tissues.  Since we still have an incomplete picture of the gene targets of estrogen in the vasculature, and our understanding of SERM gene targets in the vasculature is even less well-developed, it is important to broaden the available information on this subject.  The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogens (ethinyl estradiol, estradiol benzoate, and equilin) and SERMs (tamoxifen and raloxifene) cause differential gene and protein expression in the vasculature.  DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR were used to investigate gene expression in the mesenteric arteries of estrogen and SERM treated ovariectomized rats. The genes shown to be differentially expressed included stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), secreted frizzled related protein-4 (SFRP-4), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), phospholipase A2 group 1B (PLA2-G1B), and fatty acid synthase (FAS).  Western blot further confirmed the differential expression of sEH, SFRP-4, FAS, and SCD protein.  These results reveal that estrogens and SERMs cause differential gene and protein expression in the mesenteric artery.  Consequently, the use of these agents may be associated with a unique profile of functional and structural changes in the mesenteric arterial circulation.   Goal of the experiment:  To examine the effects of three formulations of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol, equilin, and estradiol benzoate) and of the selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and raloxifene, on gene expression in the mesenteric arteries of the rat.  Keywords:  rat, artery, gene expression, mesentery, estrogen, tamoxifen, raloxifene  Experimental factors:  hormone treatment, drug treatment  Experimental design:  Prepubertal female Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were ovariectomized at 4 weeks of age, prior to the initiation of regular ovarian cycles.  The animals were allowed to recover for 2 weeks before the experimental protocol was initiated.  The rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=3-4/group) and treated by daily gavage for 3 weeks with the vehicle (20% 2-hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin, Sigma, St Louis, MO), ethinyl estradiol (EE, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), estradiol benzoate (EB, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), equilin (EQ, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), tamoxifen (TAM, 3 mg/kg; Sigma), or raloxifene (RAL, 3 mg/kg; Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN).   After 3 weeks of treatment, the rats were euthanized and the mesentery obtained.  Total RNA was extracted from each individual sample and used for the synthesis of labeled cRNA for microarray analysis. After the final gavage treatment on day 21, the rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by decapitation.  The mesenteric arterial tree was isolated and harvested and stored in RNAlater (Ambion) at -80ºC.  The mesenteric arteries were dissected free from veins and surrounding fat and homogenized in TRI reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). Mesenteric artery RNA was extracted and purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).  Any potentially contaminating DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) on the RNeasy column.  Total RNA was quantified and RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA).  Following analysis, the RNA was stored at -80ºC until it was used for gene expression studies. DNA microarray:  CodeLink Whole Rat Genome Bioarrays (Applied Microarrays, Tempe, AZ) were used.  Five ?g total RNA was used from each mesenteric arterial sample for the microarray analysis.  Complementary RNA was synthesized per company protocol (Ambion).  A set of bacterial RNAs was added to each total RNA sample and carried through the synthesis and labeling reactions as controls and for nor¬malization of the data.  The microarrays were scanned with the GenePix 4000B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) with GenePix Pro 5.0 software (Axon Instruments).  Analysis of the microar¬rays was performed with the CodeLink Expression Analysis software (Applied Microarrays) and Acuity 3.1 software (Axon), and statistical analysis was performed with GeneSpring 7.1 software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).  A sample of n=3 was completed with the microarrays for each treatment.  Quality control steps:  The cRNA that was synthesized from each mesenteric artery treatment sample was used for hybridization to a single CodeLink (Applied Microarrays) whole rat genome microarray.  Only one sample was hybridized with each slide and only one dye (streptavidin-Alexa 647) was used so no dye swaps were used.  Bacterial control spikes were used per manufacturer's instructions.  Samples used, extract preparation and labeling: The origin of each biological sample:  The samples were isolated mesenteric arteries from individual Sprague Dawley rats that had been treated by daily gavage for 3 weeks with the vehicle (20% 2-hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin, Sigma, St Louis, MO), ethinyl estradiol (EE, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), estradiol benzoate (EB, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), equilin (EQ, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), tamoxifen (TAM, 3 mg/kg; Sigma), or raloxifene (RAL, 3 mg/kg; Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN).    Manipulations of biological samples and protocols used:  Ovariectomized female rats were treated by daily gavage for 3 weeks with the vehicle (20% 2-hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin, Sigma, St Louis, MO), ethinyl estradiol (EE, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), estradiol benzoate (EB, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), equilin (EQ, 0.15 mg/kg; Sigma), tamoxifen (TAM, 3 mg/kg; Sigma), or raloxifene (RAL, 3 mg/kg; Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN).

The mesenteric arteries were dissected free from veins and surrounding fat and homogenized in TRI reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH).  Experimental factor:  hormone treatment, drug treatment   Technical protocols:  The mesenteric arteries were minced with scalpels and TRI reagent (MRC) was added.  The tissue was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer.  Bromochloropropane and sodium acetate were added, and the samples were centrifuged to separate the phases.  The RNA-containing layer was removed and the RNA purified on an RNeasy extraction column (Qiagen).  The sample was treated with an on-column DNase treatment (RNase-free DNase, Qiagen).  The purity and quantity were evaluated by an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nanoassay LabChip.  Labeled cRNA was prepared using the Message Amp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit from Ambion, following the manufacturer's Instruction Protocol.  5.0 microgram of rat mesenteric artery total RNA was mixed with bacterial control RNA spikes and primed with T7 oligo(dT) primer for 10 min at 70C.  (The bacterial control spikes included araB, entF, fixB, gnd, hisB, and leuB.)  The first strand of cDNA was synthesized with first strand buffer, dNTP mix, RNase inhibitor, and reverse transcriptase for 2 h at 42C.  The second strand cDNA synthesis reaction was prepared using second strand buffer, dNTP mix, DNA polymerase mix, and RNase H; the reaction was carried out for 2h at 16C.  The double-stranded cDNA was purified on spin columns included in the Ambion kit.  The double-stranded cDNA was mixed with T7 reaction buffer, T7 ATP, T7 GTP, T7 UTP, T7 CTP, biotin-11-UTP, and T7 enzyme mix for the synthesis of cRNA.  The cRNA synthesis reaction was terminated after 14h at 37C by purifying the cRNA on spin columns from the Ambion kit.  The concentration of cRNA was determined by spectrophotometry.    Hybridization procedures and parameters:  10 micrograms of biotinylated cRNA was mixed with fragmentation buffer and heated to 94C for 20 min.  The fragmented cRNA was mixed with CodeLink hybridization buffer, loaded on the microarray slides (CodeLink Whole Rat Genome Bioarrays), and hybridized for 18 hours at 37C.

These vesicles are implicated in cell-to-cell communication, deliver proteins and mRNA molecules between cells. Recent studies have shown that exosomes are found in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, amniotic fluid, malignant ascites, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, synovial fluids and breast milk. Exosomes secreted through human saliva contain mRNA may potentially be useful for diagnostic purposes. Although the exact protective mechanism of saliva RNA is a topic of debate, the consensus is that the enrichment of mRNAs in these nano-vesicles in one of the features of the biomarker discoveries. Our aim was to determine if exosomes are present in human saliva and to nano-characterize their transcriptomic content.  Exosomes were purified by differential ultracentrifugation, identified by immunoelectron microscopy, flow cytometry and western blot using a CD-63 antibody. Atomic force microscopy studies revealed ultra structural analysis of both size and density of exosomes. Microarray analysis revealed the presence of 590 mRNA core transcripts are relatively stable inside the exosomes, which can be of saliva mRNA biomarkers.  Exosomal mRNA stability was determined by detergent lyses with treatment of RNase.  Under in vitro conditions fluorescent dye labeled saliva exosomes were able to communicate between human oral keratinocytes studied by using fluorescence microscopy. The RNA from saliva exosomes can transfer their genetic information to human oral keratinocytes and alters gene expression in the new location.  Together, these results suggest that saliva is involved in mRNA trafficking via exosomes, and provides a mechanism for cargoing passenger mRNAs. Our findings are consistent with proposal that exosomes can shuttle RNAs between cells and mRNA is protected inside these vesicles may be a possible resource for biomarker discovery.  Experiment Overall Design: Human saliva exosomes were purified through differential centrifugation followed by RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We were able to obtain normal human subjects saliva which are pooled and subjected to ultracentrifugation.

Biological experiments were carried out twice (i.e. control (water added) and experiment (ZnSO4 added) chemostats were grown separately twice), and a dye swap performed for each experiment, providing at least two technical repeats for each of the two biological repeats at all five time points.  Slides were analysed so that time points “with Zn” were compared to the same time point “without Zn” (e.g. 30 min after Zn was added was compared to 30 min after water being added). Cells were grown in glycerol-glycerophosphate medium (GGM) lacking Zn.  Final concentrations in GGM are: MES (40.0 mM), NH4Cl (18.7 mM), KCl (13.4 mM), beta-glycerophosphate (7.64 mM), glycerol (5.00 mM), K2SO4 (4.99 mM), MgCl2 (1.00 mM), EDTA (134 microM), CaCl2.2H2O (68.0 microM), FeCl3.6H2O (18.5 microM), H3BO3 (1.62 microM), CuCl2.2H2O (587 nM), CoNO3.6H2O (344 nM), and (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O (80.9 nM) in MilliQ water (Millipore).  Bulk elements (MES, NH4Cl, KCl, K2SO4 and glycerol in MilliQ water at pH 7.4 (batch growth) or 7.6 (continuous culture)) were passed through a column containing Chelex-100 ion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) to remove contaminating cations.  Trace elements (with no added Zn) and a CaCl2 solution were then added to give the final concentrations shown above prior to autoclaving.  After autoclaving, MgCl2 and beta-glycerophosphate were added at the final concentrations shown above.  All chemicals were of AnalaR grade of purity or higher.  Chelex-100 was packed into a Bio-Rad Glass Econo-column (approximately 120 mm × 25 mm) that had previously been soaked in 3.5% nitric acid for 5 d.  E. coli strain MG1655 was grown a custom-built chemostat made entirely of non-metal parts.  Glass growth vessels and flow-back traps were soaked extensively (approximately two months) in 10% nitric acid before being rinsed thoroughly in MilliQ water.  Vent filters (Vent Acro 50 from VWR) were connected to the vessel using PTFE tubing.  Metal-free pipette tips were used (MAXYMum Recovery Filter Tips from Axygen).  Culture volume was maintained at 120 ml using an overflow weir in the chemostat vessel.  The dilution rate (and hence the specific growth rate) was 0.1 h-1.   The vessel was inoculated using one of the side-arms.  Flasks were placed on KMO 2 Basic IKA-Werke stirrers (arbitrary setting: 400).  Stirring speed was calibrated (440 rpm) and matched between vessels using a handheld laser tachometer (Compact Instruments Ltd).  Temperature was kept constant at 37 oC.  Twice daily, a 2-ml sample was taken and used to test the pH (which stayed constant at pH 6.9), OD600 (0.6 at steady state), glycerol limitation, and contamination on nutrient agar plates.  E. coli strain MG1655 was grown in a “Zn-free” chemostat.  Chemostats were grown for 50 h to allow five culture volumes to pass through the vessel and allow an apparent (pseudo-)steady state to be reached.   At this point, ZnSO4.7H2O in water was added to a final concentration of 0.2 M in the chemostat.  A 10 ml sample of culture was taken using a polypropylene pipette tip immediately prior to Zn addition and 2.5, 7, 10 and 30 min after addition.  Total RNA was stabilised using RNAprotect (Qiagen).  Total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy mini kit.  A control experiment was carried out in which water was added.  Microarray slides were set up so that time points “with Zn” were compared to the same time point “without Zn” (e.g. 30 min after Zn was added was compared to 30 min after water being added).  For each time point, equal quantities of RNA obtained after addition of zinc and addition of water were labelled by using nucleotide analogues of dCTP containing either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes (Perkin Elmer).  For each microarray slide, one sample was labelled with Cy3-dCTP, while the other sample was labelled with Cy5-dCTP.  RNA (15-20 micrograms) was annealed to 9 micrograms pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC.  This was supplemented with 4 microlitres of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2 microlitres dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 2 microlitres 0.1 M DTT, 2 microlitres 1 mM Cy3 or Cy5 (Perkin Elmer) and 1 microlitre Superscript II reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 2 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (5 microlitres of 1M) and HCl (5 microlitres of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (200 microlitres).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).  The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample and re-suspended in 120 microlitres salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 1× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min before scanning.  Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).  Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.  Biological experiments were carried out twice times, and a dye swap performed for each experiment, providing at least two technical repeats for each of the two biological repeats at all five time points.  Data from the independent experiments were combined.  Genes that were differentially expressed ? twofold and displayed and P value of < 0.05 (as determined by a t test) were defined as being statistically significantly differentially transcribed.","AE_experiment_type":"EFO\u001fhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0002768","AE_species":"NCBITAXON\u001fhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_562","AE_name":"Transcriptional profiling of Escherichia coli during a transition from zinc starvation to surfeit"},{"AE_description":"In order to study the function of the Campylobacter jejuni Cj0138 gene, a series of experiments were carried out.

Briefly, in a typical preparation, 8x106 cells (grown in Schneider medium plus 10% fetal calf serum; GIBCO-BRL) were pelleted and resuspended in 1,5 mL cold PBS1X; the cell suspension is then tranferred to a microfuge tube. Cells are pelleted for 10 seconds and resuspended in 400 µL cold Buffer A (10mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9 at 4°C, 1.5mM MgCl2, 10mM KCl, 0.5mM duthiothreitol, 0.2mM PMSF, 0.2U/microL RNasin). The cells are allowed to swell on ice for 10 minutes, and then vortexed for 10 seconds. Samples are centrifuged for 10 seconds, and the supernatant fraction is discarded. The pellet is resuspended in 100 µL of cold Buffer C (20mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420mM NaCl, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.5mM dithiothreitol, 0.2mM PMSF) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high-salt extraction. Cellular debris is removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4°C and the supernatant fraction is stored at –70°C. All buffers were prepared from double-distilled autoclaved water that had been treated with 0.1% DEPC (Sigma).RNA immunoprecipitation and Reverse TranscriptionFor RNA immunopreciptation, the nuclear extract was incubated whit 50µg of monoclonal C1A9 anti HP1 antibody and the mixture was kept at  4°C overnight under continuous gentle movement. One-hundred  microliters ofprotein G-Sepharose (Sigma) suspension (50% packed Sepharose in Buffer C) was added  and the incubation was continued overnight as described.The beads were pelleted by 2 min centrifugation at 240 g at 4°C; the pellet was washed briefly three times whit each 1mL of IP Wash Solution (150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5% NP40) and the Sepharose was transferred for eluition into a fresh plastic tube , pelleted again and then the supernatant was removed completely. To elute the immunocomplexes for protein analysis, an aliquot of beads were suspended in 50µL SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated for 10 min at 90°C; following centrifugation the supernatant was removed and used for Western blot for testing the presence of HP1 protein.To elute the immunoprecipitated RNAs, the pelleted beads were boiled in 200µL of DEPC wather for 5 min, spun, and the supernatant recovered; 1mL of Trizol (Invitrogen) was added to 200 µL of supernatant and mixed well, followed by the addition of 200µL of chloroform.

Contaminating DNA was digested whit RNase-free DNase I (Sigma). The RNA purified from the previous step is used as a template to synthesize cDNA using oligo dT , random hexamers and SuperScript reverse transcriptase III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  cDNA amplification and labelingThe cDNA was used as template for a two-step random PCR amplification; in Round A, Sequenase is used to extend randomly annealed primers (Primer A) to generate templates for subsequent PCR; during Round B, the specific primer B is used to aplify the templates previously generated and finally round C consist of additional PCR cycles to inorporate the amino allyl dUTP nucleotide.

The resulting products were used as template for 25 cycles of PCR using 1U/100µl Taq polymerase (Platinum Taq Invitrogen) and 10mM Round B primer (5’-GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TC-3’). Finally this DNA was used as template for 25  cycles PCR to inorporate the amino allyl dUTP nucleotides to which the fluorescent dye may then be attached.

Ionizing radiation (IR), both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent, induces TGFbeta activation in vivo. We now show that IR sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to undergo TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Non-malignant HMEC (MCF10A, HMT3522 S1 and 184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in monolayer culture, or treated with a low concentration of TGFbeta (0.4 ng/ml), or double-treated. All double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) HMEC underwent a morphological shift from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, beta-catenin and ZO-1, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, fibronectin and vimentin. Furthermore, double-treatment increased cell motility, promoted invasion and disrupted acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel. Neither radiation nor TGFbeta alone elicited EMT, even though IR increased chronic TGFbeta signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double treated cells exhibit a specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/MAPK signaling. We hypothesized that IR-induced MAPK activation primes non-malignant HMEC to undergo TGFbeta-mediated EMT. Consistent with this, Erk phosphorylation were transiently induced by irradiation, persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFbeta, and treatment with U0126, a Mek inhibitor, blocked the EMT phenotype. Together, these data demonstrate that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic progression. Experiment Overall Design: Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (passages 106 and 108) were seeded at cloning density in 35mm dishes (10^5 cells/dish). Cell culture medium consisted of 3ml/dish of MGEM serum free medium (Cambrex Inc.), supplemented or not with 400pg/ml recombinant Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Cells were irradiated or not 5h post plating using 160 KV X-ray with a total dose of 2Gy. Sham, IR-treated, TGFbeta-treated and double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) MCF10A cells were harvested 8 days post-IR. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, denatured in Trizol, scraped off the dish and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation, the upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA precipitates were resuspended in RNase free water and further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Germany). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent Bio-Analyzer. The dataset analyzed by microarray included biological duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three sham treated samples. Microarray data were generated at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling Laboratory (http://hta.lbl.gov) using a high-throughput, automated GeneChip system (Affymetrix). Briefly, target preparation, HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup, washing and staining were performed on an Affymetrix robotic system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols.

Samples were analyzed and clustered with the (UNO) One Color GenetrafficTM software version 3.2-12 (Iobion Informatics LLC, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Genes whose expression was specifically altered by treatment were defined as those in which dye ratio was more than 1.75-fold (|mean log2ratio|>0.8) from baseline in at least three out of the four treated samples compared to the three sham samples.

Some of the virulence genes were down regulated by more than 16-32 fold. These results indicate that SDH plays an important role in the regulation of virulence. S.pyogenes strain SF370 (wild-type) was procured from ATCC (ATCC 700294). M1-SDHHbtail (SDH cytoplasmically retained) mutant strain PGB-1 was obtained using pFW5 vector as described before ( Boel G.

Bacteria  were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile PBS. Total RNA was isolated from  these washed streptococci using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit.  For synthesis and labeling of cDNA, 20 ug of total RNA, 1.5 ug of random hexamer, 0.5mM dNTPs (except that 0.2mM of dTTP was replaced by the same amount of amino-allyl dUTP to incorporate dUTP into first-strand cDNA) were used in each reverse transcriptase reaction (Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen).  Purified cDNA preparations from the wild-type and PGB1 mutant strains were labeled with either Alexafluor-555 or Alexafluor-647 depending on the experimental design ( i.e. dye swap experiment). Differentially labeled probes were then combined and purified.  Using three independently isolated RNA preparations (biological replicates), a total of 8 experiments (incorporating  dye swaps) were performed. Accordingly eight hybridization measurements for this mutant were performed. Thus Exp-1 and -2 (GSM380310, GSM380320) are the technical replicates of the biological sample-1, Exp-3,-4 and -5 (GSM380321, GSM380322, GSM380331) are technical replicates of biological sample-2 and Exp-6,-7, and -8 (GSM380332,GSM380333, GSM380334) are technical replicates of the biological sample-3.

The resulting images were processed using Gene Pix Pro  software (version 4.0, Axon instruments). The raw data were obtained in the form of GenPix  *.gpr output files.  The web application CARMAweb (Comprehensive R based microarray analysis web service) was used for the normalization and analysis of microarray data.  All raw data (in the form of  *.

Using appropriate navigation tree, background correction from the foreground signal was applied and within microarray normalization was achieved using the Lowess method.

Results showed that onset of fermentation caused drastic changes in gene expression profiles within 15 min. Genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were down-regulated and genes involved in glycolysis were up-regulated, indicating a metabolic shift from respiration to fermentation. Genes involved in ethanol production (PDC genes and ADH1), in glycerol synthesis (GPD1 and HOR2), and in low-affinity hexose transporters (HXT1 and HXT3) were up-regulated at the beginning of model dough-fermentation. Among genes up-regulated at 15 min, several genes classified as transcription were down-regulated within 30 min. These down-regulated genes are involved in messenger RNA splicing and ribosomal protein biogenesis, in zinc finger transcription factor proteins, and in transcriptional regulator (SRB8, MIG1). In contrast, genes involved in amino acid metabolism and in vitamin metabolism, such as arginine biosynthesis, riboflavin biosynthesis, and thiamin biosynthesis, were subsequently up-regulated after 30 min. Interestingly, the genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway were also subsequently up-regulated. Our study presents the first overall description of the transcriptional response of baker’s yeast during dough-fermentation, and will thus help clarify genomic responses to various stresses during commercial fermentation processes.

This study tested the hypothesis that reciprocal communication occurs between macrophages and cultured human endometrial stromal cells and that this communication contributes to the pathology of endometriosis.  Changes in gene expression elicited by exposure to factors secreted by the opposing cell type were measured by DNA microarray to test this hypothesis.  716 named genes were differentially expressed in cultured endometrial stromal cells in response to factors secreted by macrophages.  Genes that were up-regulated included IL8/CXCL8, MMP3, phospholamban, CYR61/CCN1, CTGF/CCN2, tenascin C, and NNMT, whereas integrin alpha 6 was down-regulated.  In contrast, 15 named genes were differentially expressed in macrophages in response to factors secreted by cultured endometrial stromal cells.   The data document reciprocal communication between macrophages and endometrial stromal cells and suggest that interaction with macrophages stimulates the expression of genes in endometrial stromal cells that contribute to migration, adhesion, invasion, neovascularization and mitosis of endometrial cells that may support the establishment of endometriosis.  Experiment Design:   Goal of the experiment:  To examine reciprocal communication between a telomerase-immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line (THESC, ATCC #CRL-4003) and U-937 macrophages (ATCC #CRL-1593.2 treated with phorbol ester to stimulate differentiation), and also to assess the response of THESC cells to estrogen plus progesterone.  Keywords:  human, cultured endometrial stromal cell line, macrophage  Experimental factors:  hormone treatment and treatment with macrophage-conditioned medium of endometrial stromal cells, treatment of macrophages with endometrial stromal cell conditioned medium  Experimental design:  T HESC cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1% ITS+, 10% charcoal-dextran treated fetal bovine serum albumin, 1% pen/strep, and 500 ng/ml puromycin.  THESC cells were treated for 8 days with vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or estradiol (10-8 M) plus progesterone (10-7 M medroxyprogesterone acetate).  On day 6, serum was removed from the culture medium.  On day 7, half of the cells were treated with U-937 macrophage-conditioned medium for 24 hours.  The cells were harvested and RNA extracted on day 8.  The experiment was repeated with three different passages of cells (passages 9, 11, and 13) to yield an experimental n of 3.  The four groups of cells were vehicle-treated control, estradiol + progesterone, control + macrophage-conditioned medium, and estradiol + progesterone + macrophage-conditioned medium.    The monocytic cell line, U-937, was maintained in suspension in RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% pen/strep.  The U-937 cells were treated with 32 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 48 h to stimulate differentiation into macrophages.  The U-937 macrophages were treated with THESC conditioned medium or with non-conditioned control medium.  Total RNA was collected after 24 hours.  The experiment was repeated with three different passages of cells (passages 7, 9, and 12) to yield an experimental n of 3.  The two experimental groups were macrophages treated with non-conditioned control medium and macrophages treated with THESC-conditioned medium.  Quality control steps:  The cRNA that was synthesized from each cultured cell passage and treatment was used for hybridization to a single CodeLink (Applied Microarrays) whole human genome microarray.  Only one sample was hybridized with each slide and only one dye (streptavidin-Alexa 647) was used so no dye swaps were necessary.  Bacterial control spikes were used per manufacturer's instructions.  Samples used, extract preparation and labelling: The origin of each biological sample:  The samples were telomerase-immortalized human endometrial stromal cells and human U-937 monocytic cell line differentiation into macrophages by treatment with phorbol ester.  The cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (#CRL-4003 and #CRL-1593.2).    Manipulations of biological samples and protocols used:  T HESC cells were grown in culture in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1% ITS+, 2% charcoal/dextran treated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 500 ng/ml puromycin.  The cells were treated for 8 days with vehicle (0.1% ethanol), estradiol (10-8 M) plus progesterone (10-7 M medroxyprogesterone acetate), vehicle + macrophage-conditioned medium, or estradiol (10-8 M) + progesterone (medroxyprogesterone acetate 10-7 M) + macrophage-conditioned medium.   On day 6, serum was removed from the culture medium of all cells.  On day 7, half of the cells were treated with macrophage-conditioned medium for 24 hours.  The cells were harvested and RNA extracted on day 8.  The experiment was repeated with three different passages of cells (passages 9, 11, and 13) to yield an experimental n of 3.  The four groups of cells were vehicle-treated control, estradiol + progesterone, control + macrophage-conditioned medium, and estradiol + progesterone + macrophage-conditioned medium.  To prepare macrophage-conditioned medium, U-937 (ATCC #CRL-1593.2) cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum until the cells covered 80% of the flask surface.  These U-937 cells were treated with 32 nM PMA for 48 h to stimulate differentiation into macrophages.  Differentiated macrophages were maintained in phenol red-free, fetal bovine serum-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 48 hours.  The cell suspension was centrifuged and the conditioned medium was collected, filtered, and stored at -80C.  Before use, macrophage-conditioned medium was supplemented with 1% ITS+ and puromycin.      The monocytic cell line, U-937, was maintained in suspension in RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% pen/strep.  The U-937 cells were treated with 32 nM PMA for 48 h to stimulate differentiation into macrophages.  The differentiated macrophages were treated with THESC conditioned medium or with non-conditioned control medium.  Total RNA was collected after 24 hours.    Experimental factor:  hormone treatment, treatment with macrophage-conditioned medium, and treatment with T-HESC cell conditioned medium  Technical protocols:  The cells were rinsed and TRI reagent (MRC) was added to the culture flasks.  The cells were scraped into centrifuge tubes, bromochloropropane and sodium acetate were added, and the samples were centrifuged to separate the phases.  The RNA-containing layer was removed and the RNA purified on an RNeasy extraction column (Qiagen).  The sample was treated with an on-column DNase treatment (RNase-free DNase, Qiagen).  The purity and quantity were evaluated by an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nanoassay LabChip.  Labelled cRNA was prepared using the Message Amp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit from Ambion, following the manufacturer's Instruction Protocol.  1.0 microgram of T-HESC cell total RNA or 2 micrograms of macrophage total RNA was mixed with bacterial control RNA spikes and primed with T7 oligo(dT) primer for 10 min at 70C.  (The bacterial control spikes included araB, entF, fixB, gnd, hisB, and leuB.)  The first strand of cDNA was synthesized with first strand buffer, dNTP mix, RNase inhibitor, and reverse transcriptase for 2 h at 42C.  The second strand cDNA synthesis reaction was prepared using second strand buffer, dNTP mix, DNA polymerase mix, and RNase H; the reaction was carried out for 2h at 16C.  The double-stranded cDNA was purified on spin columns included in the Ambion kit.  The double-stranded cDNA was mixed with T7 reaction buffer, T7 ATP, T7 GTP, T7 UTP, T7 CTP, biotin-11-UTP, and T7 enzyme mix for the synthesis of cRNA.  The cRNA synthesis reaction was terminated after 14h at 37C by purifying the cRNA on spin columns from the Ambion kit.  The concentration of cRNA was determined by spectrophotometry.    Hybridization procedures and parameters:  10 micrograms of biotinylated cRNA was mixed with fragmentation buffer and heated to 94C for 20 min.  The fragmented cRNA was mixed with CodeLink hybridization buffer, loaded on the microarray slides, and hybridized for 18 hours at 37C.   The slides were washed in 0.75x TNT (Tris-HCl, NaCl, Tween-20) at 46C for 1h then incubated with streptavidin-Alexa 647 fluorescent dye for 30 min at room temperature.  The streptavidin-Alexa 647 fluor was prepared in TNB blocking buffer (0.1M Tris-HCl, 0.15M NaCL, 0.5% NEN Blocking Reagent-PerkinElmer)  The slides were then washed 4 times for 5 min each in 1x TNT and twice in 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 sec each.  The slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned in an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner.","AE_experiment_type":"EFO\u001fhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0002768","AE_species":"NCBITAXON\u001fhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_9606","AE_name":"Reciprocal communication between endometrial stromal cells and macrophages"},{"AE_description":"Core binding factor (CBF) leukemias, characterized by translocations t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16) targeting the core binding factor, constitute acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subgroups with favorable prognosis. However, about 40% of patients relapse, and the current classification system does not fully reflect this clinical heterogeneity. Previously, gene expression profiling (GEP) revealed two distinct CBF leukemia subgroups displaying significant outcome differences and identified apoptotic signaling, MAPKinase signaling and chemotherapy-resistance mechanisms among the most significant differentially regulated pathways. We now tested different inhibitors of the respective pathways in a cell line model (six cell lines reflecting the CBF subgroup specific gene expression alterations), and found apoptotic signaling to be differentiating between the CBF subgroup models. In accordance, primary samples from newly diagnosed CBF AML patients (n=23) also showed differential sensitivity to in vitro treatment with a Smac mimetic such as BV6, an antagonist of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins , and ABT-737, a BCL2 inhibitor. Furthermore, GEP revealed the BV6 resistant cases to resemble the previously identified unfavorable CBF subgroup. Thus, our current findings show deregulated IAP expression and apoptotic signaling to differentiate clinically relevant CBF subgroups, which were independent of known molecular markers, thereby providing a starting point for novel therapeutic approaches. All samples were obtained from untreated patients at the time of diagnosis.

Exposure to WLS evoked a multitude of transcriptional responses in Mtb, with 52 genes up-regulated and 23 genes down-regulated at 30 min exposure, plus 146 genes up-regulated and 27 genes down-regulated at 2 h.  Notably, WLS rapidly induced several membrane-associated lipases that presumptively act on surfactant lipids as substrates, and a large number of genes involved in the synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), a cell wall component known to be important in macrophage interactions and Mtb virulence. Exposure of Mtb to CLSE, PPL, or purified SP-A caused a substantially weaker transcriptional response (? 20 genes were induced) suggesting that interactions among multiple lipid-protein components of WLS may contribute to its effects on Mtb transcription.  Whole lung surfactant (WLS) was obtained by centrifugation of lavage fluid (0.15M NaCl) from the intact lungs of freshly killed calves (ONY, Inc, Amherst, NY). Centrifugation was done at 12,000 x g at room temperature to pellet the active large aggregate surfactant fraction. CLSE was prepared by extraction of WLS into chloroform-methanol by the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959), as described in our prior work (Notter et al. 2002). CLSE is conceptually identical to the substance of the clinical surfactant Infasurf®. The composition of CLSE by weight was approximately 94% phospholipid, 4.5% cholesterol, and 1.5% protein (a mixture of SP-B and SP-C) as defined previously (Notter et al. 2002). Mixed lung surfactant phospholipids (PPL) were isolated from CLSE by column chromatography with an elution solvent of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform-methanol plus 5% 0.1 N HCl. Two passes through a Sephadex LH-20 column (Pharmacia-LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ) separated phospholipids away from hydrophobic surfactant apoproteins and neutral lipids. Acid remaining in PPL fractions was removed by a second chloroform-methanol extraction. Final PPL had a protein content below the limits of detection of both the Folin-phenol assay of Lowry et al. (1951) and the amido black assay of Kaplin and Pedersen (1989) modified by the addition of 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to allow accurate quantitation in the presence of lipid.  Human SP-A was a gift from Dr. J. R. Wright at Duke University, and was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with alveolar proteinosis as described previously (Wright et al. 1987).  For exposure studies with Mtb, amounts of WLS, CLSE, and PPL used per experiment were 3.3 mg in a total volume of 4 ml. In preliminary studies, this concentration was shown to induce a transcriptional response in Mtb without affecting viability after a 2 h treatment as determined by serial dilutions compared to untreated Mtb.   SP-A was studied at a level of 0.165 mg based on its putative concentration of approximately 5% in endogenous surfactant.   To determine the effects of lung surfactant on the transcriptional response of Mtb, preparations of WLS, CLSE, or PPL (in 650 µl PBS) were initially coated onto the bottom surface of a 25 cm2 cell culture flask for 30 min at 37oC to mimic a surfactant layer. A minimum of two independent biological replicates were studied for each surfactant preparation. Purified human SP-A was also examined for its effects on Mtb transcription, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a “no treatment” control. In experiments with SP-A (in 650 µl PBS), the pure apoprotein was either pre-coated on the flask as done with the surfactant preparations, or was directly added and incubated with Mtb during study. Mtb was added to the flask in 3.35 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 5 mM HEPES) and exposed to coated surfactant/SP-A or PBS control for 30 min or 2h at 37oC, followed by RNA isolation as detailed by Rohde et al. (2008). GTC lysis/stabilization buffer was added, and pelleted Mtb were washed and then digested with lysozyme. TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added, and organisms were disrupted using glass beads in a Mini-Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc. Bartlesville, OK). After extraction of Mtb lysates with chloroform, ethanol was added to the aqueous phase before loading samples onto RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Subsequent steps were then performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following elution with RNase-free water, the RNA samples were treated with DNase (Turbo DNAfree, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stored at -70oC until analysis.     The MessageAmpTMII-Bacteria system (Applied Biosystems) was used to amplify mycobacterial RNA for all samples [16]. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to yield double-stranded amino-allyl modified aRNA, which was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Excess reactive dyes were removed with a Mega Clear purification kit (Applied Biosystems).  Next, Alexa-labeled aRNA from paired samples was dried using a Speedvac, and re-suspended in hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 25% formamide, 0.15% SDS, and 25 ?g salmon sperm DNA). The mixed samples were denatured by being heated to 95oC for and then cooled to 50oC prior to loading them onto microarrays.  The arrays were hybridized for approximately 15 h at 45oC, washed and then dried by centrifugation.  Fluorescence intensity data from each array were collected with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) using GenePixPro3.0 software (Axon Instruments).  Image analysis, i.e. spot identification, background measurements, quality assessment and flagging were conducted with Imagene software (Version 6.0, BioDiscovery, Inc., El Segundo, CA).  Poor quality spots were filtered and removed from the analysis.  Subsequent normalization, statistical analysis (i.e. t-test), and visualization of array data was conducted using Genespring (Version 7, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).","AE_experiment_type":"EFO\u001fhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0002768","AE_species":"NCBITAXON\u001fhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_1773","AE_name":"Transcriptional responses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to lung surfactant"},{"AE_description":"The transcriptome of Blochmannia floridanus, the endosymbiont of the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus, is presented during eight developmental stages of its holometabolous host by use of a whole genome DNA-macroarray. The detected transcription patterns indicate the presence of local transcription units as well as global regulatory mechanisms. Yet, the overall regulation scale is very modest, rarely exceeding a factor of three which is in line with the low number of transcriptional regulators present in this reduced genome. A large number of genes show differential expression in different life stages and a distinct expression pattern of genes possibly involved in symbiotic function as compared to housekeeping genes is apparent. However, these transcriptional changes are small as compared to the changes in the number of bacteria during host development which is highest in pupae and in young imagines. Control of replication of the bacteria in certain life stages may therefore be the decisive parameter influencing overall gene expression of Blochmannia in the animal. The few highly expressed genes like those encoding molecular chaperones exhibit a significantly higher G+C-content than moderately expressed genes.  Keywords: Host stage-dependent gene expression C. floridanus laboratory colonies were maintained under constant conditions at 25°C with a 12 h light cycle in artificial nests and fed twice a week with cockroaches (Nauphoeta cinerea), Bhatkar agar (Bhatkar and Whitcomb, 1970), and honey water (50% wt/wt) ad libitum. Developmental stages were defined as L1 (very young larvae, still clustered), L2 (older larvae, approx. 2-4 mm), P1 (pupae before metamorphosis), P2 (pupae after metamorphosis, still uncolored), P3 (pupae shortly before eclosion with dark abdomens), W1 (workers shortly after eclosion, not completely melanized, no aggressive behavior), W2 (fully melanized adult workers from the nest, age not distinguishable), and W3 (adult workers from isolated subcolonies, at least 4 months old). For RNA preparations, midguts of the respective life stage (L2 - W3) were dissected and bacteria were isolated by homogenization and centrifugation. Endosymbionts from small larvae (L1) were isolated from whole animals. RNA for each cDNA array experiment was isolated from individual bacterial preparations; from L1 to W2, each developmental stage was represented by at least three independent experiments and samples from at least three different ant colonies. Two ant colonies (C79 and C118) were represented in every stage from L1 to W2 with additional samples from six other colonies.

Most notably the functional categories that were affected include Virulence genes (18 genes  11% of the total significantly differentiated genes), carbohydrate metabolism  and cell envelop realted genes ( 31, 19.1% of the total),  and aminoacid transport genes (21genes, 12.9%).  Among the virulence-related genes, the most notable one were those belong to the production of capsule, the M protein, exotoxin, NAD glycohydrolase and Streptolysin S. Some of the capsule related genes were down regulated by more than 64 fold. These results indicate that CdhA (group A Streptococcal Cell division controlling and Chain-forming cell wall hydrolase) plays an important role in the regulation of virulence. S.pyogenes strain SF370 (wild-type) was procured from ATCC (ATCC 700294). M1-CdhA(-) mutant strain was obtained using pFW5 vector containing spectinomycin resistance marker (aad9). The mutant lacking CdhA is highly defective in cell division and growth,  lacks antiphagocytic property and attenuated for virulence. Both strains  (M1-Wild-type and M1-CdhA(-) were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth to their late log phase. Bacteria  were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile PBS. Total RNA was isolated from  these washed streptococci using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit.  For synthesis and labeling of cDNA, 20 ug of total RNA, 1.5 ug of random hexamer, 0.5mM dNTPs (except that 0.2mM of dTTP was replaced by the same amount of amino-allyl dUTP to incorporate dUTP into first-strand cDNA) were used in each reverse transcriptase reaction (Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen).  Purified cDNA preparations from the wild-type and  M1CdhA(-) mutant strains were labeled with either Alexafluor-555 or Alexafluor-647 depending on the experimental design ( i.e. dye swap experiment). Differentially labeled probes were then combined and purified.  Using three independently isolated RNA preparations (biological replicates), a total of 11 experiments (incorporating  dye swaps) were performed. Accordingly eleven hybridization measurements for this mutant were performed. Thus Exp-1 to -4 (GSM388703, GSM388717, GSM388718 and GSM388719) are the technical replicates of the biological sample-1, Exp-5 to 8(GSM388732, GSM388733, GSM388734, and GSM388735) are technical replicates of biological sample-2 and Exp-9,-10, and -11 (GSM388736,GSM388737, and GSM388738) are technical replicates of the biological sample-3.   Signals of the bound reagents on the microarray spots in terms of relative fluorescence values were measured and quantified by a laser scanner (GenePix 4100 ) at 10um/pixel resolution. The resulting images were processed using Gene Pix Pro  software (version 4.0, Axon instruments). The raw data were obtained in the form of GenPix  *.gpr output files.  The web application CARMAweb (Comprehensive R based microarray analysis web service) was used for the normalization and analysis of microarray data.  All raw data (in the form of  *.

Using appropriate navigation tree, background correction from the foreground signal was applied and within microarray normalization was achieved using the Lowess method.  Genes flagged as bad spots by the scanning software were excluded from the analysis and all flagged spots were given a weight of zero.

Despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of L. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content of this microorganism. In the present study the genomic content of L. garvieae CECT 4531 was analyzed by bioinformatic tools and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations (CGH) experiments, using Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 and Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 as reference microorganisms. Results: The combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro (CGH) experiments performed between the reference microorganisms allowed establishing an inter-species hybridization framework with a detection threshold based on the sequence similarity ?70%. With this threshold value, 267 genes were identified as having an analogue in L. garvieae, most of which (n = 258) have been documented for the first time in this pathogen. Most of these genes are related to ribosomal, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems. Some identified genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of L. garvieae infections.  Conclusions: In this study a comparative analysis based on microarray interspecies hybridization and the use of bioinformatic tools were used for the first time to study the genetic content of L. garvieae CECT 4531. Towards this approach, we identified 267 potentially present genes in L. garvieae CECT 4531, some of which could be involved in the pathogenesis of L. garvieae infections, such as als or mycA. These results provide the first insight into the genome content of L. garvieae.  Array-based comparative genome hybridization (CGH): The L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 and S. pneumoniae TIGR4 microarrays used for the CGH analysis were purchased from Eurogentec (Serain, Belgium). The L. lactis microarray contains 4608 spots: 2126 duplicated ORFs, 32 negative controls and 324 empty spots. The S. pneumoniae microarray contains 4608 spots: 2087 duplicated ORFs, 224 negative controls and 210 empty spots.  The CGH experiments were performed by means of competitive hybridizations using DNA of L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 or S. pneumoniae TIGR4, depending on the array as positive controls. DNAs to be hybridized on the same array were labelled with Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP, respectively. For each microarray hybridization reaction, aliquots (1–2 µg) of labelled genomic DNAs of reference (labelled with Cy3) and test (labelled with Cy5) strains, were mixed in 45 µl EGT hybridization solution (Eurogentec, Serain, Belgium) and denatured at 65ºC for 2 min. The hybridization mixture was then loaded onto a microarray slide, covered with a coverslip and incubated at 38ºC overnight. Following hybridization, the slides were washed in 2 X SSC, 0.5% SDS for 5 min followed by 5 min in 1 X SSC, 0.25% SDS. Finally, slides were rinsed in 0.2 X SSC and dried by centrifugation.  The results presented herein represent a compilation of sixteen separate CGH experiments: L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 arrays (reference microorganism) were hybridized with S. pneumoniae TIGR4 (test microorganism) (n=2); S. pneumoniae TIGR4 arrays (reference microorganism) were hybridized with L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 (test microorganism) (n=2); L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 arrays (reference microorganism) were hybridized with L.garvieae CECT 4531 (test microorganism) (n=8); S. pneumoniae TIGR4 arrays (reference microorganism) were hybridized with L.garvieae CECT 4531 (test microorganism) (n=4).  Data acquisition and analysis: The microarray was scanned after hybridization using a Scanarray HT microarray scanner (Perkin-Elmer). The signal intensity of the two fluors was determined using ImaGene software (BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA, USA). Microarray data were analysed using ImaGene software, Microsoft Excel and an in-house designed and built Microsoft Access database [30]. Gene calling was based on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) > 3 for each spot. After CGH experiments, a gene was considered to show a positive result when it was present in at least three of the four CGH assays. In the case of the L. garvieae CECT 4531 hybridizations with L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 arrays, it was necessary to perform a greater number of assays (n=8) due to the poor quality of one of the array batches used. Thus, the criteria chosen to determine a positive result in this case was when the gene was present in at least five of the eight CGH assays.","AE_experiment_type":"EFO\u001fhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000749","AE_species":"NCBITAXON\u001fhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_1313","AE_name":"Analysis of the genome content of Lactococcus garvieae by genomic interspecies microarray hybridization"},{"AE_description":"Cells: ACH-2, and A3.01, were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. ACH-2, is a chronically infected cell line harboring HIV-1 LAV strain, while A3.01 is the corresponding parental uninfected cell line.  Cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 5% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2mM glutamine (Invitrogen).  Cells were maintained at a concentration of 1x10e6 cells/ml in T-175 flasks. Cell concentrations and cell viability were monitored throughout the experiment at all time points studied.  Cells were induced by addition of 20 ng/mL of phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA or TPA, Sigma, St Louis, MO) for one hour, after which the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS).  Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes, at the following times after induction, 0.5, 3, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hour(s).  HIV-infected and uninfected cells maintained and harvested in parallel with the PMA-treated cells, but not induced with PMA ( No PMA)were also harvested. Harvested cells were washed thrice with ice-cold PBS to remove media; cell pellets were snap frozen using ethanol-dry ice mixture and stored at (80°C for subsequent RNA extraction. Total RNA Extraction:  Total RNA was extracted using RNEasy Midiprep Kits per manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  RNA concentrations and purity were measured by spectrophotometry, RNA quality (absence of RNA degradation) was assessed by gel electrophoresis.  RNA concentration was adjusted to the levels required for subsequent microarray experiment protocols by concentration in a SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, Holbrook, CA).  RNA samples (6-7 µg/µL) were stored in 100 µL TE buffer at -80°C.  Microarray Studies:  Total RNA obtained from induced chronically infected and corresponding uninfected parental cells were used for microarray experiments.  For each time point, RNA from the induced chronically infected ACH-2 cells and RNA from the corresponding induced, uninfected A3.01 cells were compared to minimize effects due to PMA induction. Microarrays were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Microarray Facility, Advanced Technology Center (Gaithersburg, MD).  The microarrays (Hs. UniGem2) contained 10,368 cDNA spots on each glass slide. The cDNAs were selected for spotting on the slides based on their known or probable involvement in oncogenesis, signal transduction, apoptosis, immune function, inflammatory pathways, cellular transport, transcription, protein translation and other important cellular functions.  A number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from unknown genes homologous to known genes and cDNAs encoding housekeeping genes were also included in these gene sets.  For each time point, 50 µg of total RNA from PMA induced ACH-2 cells and 70 µg of total RNA from PMA induced A3.01 cells was labeled with Cy-3-dUTP and Cy-5-dUTP respectively.  Higher amounts of RNA were used for Cy-5 labeling to minimize the disparities in dye incorporation.  Each sample of RNA from PMA-induced, infected cells from a particular time point was compared with RNA from the corresponding PMA-induced, uninfected cells from the same time point for subsequent hybridization to the same array to ensure accurate comparisons and to eliminate inter-array variability. Following reverse transcription, the labeled cDNAs were then combined and purified using MicroCon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) spin column filters, to remove any unincorporated nucleotides. 8-10 µg each of Cot-1 DNA, (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), yeast tRNA (Sigma) and polyA (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction mixture and heated at 100°C for 1 minute.  Hybridization of the labeled cDNA to the microarray was carried out at 65°C overnight, followed by washes with 1X SSC, 0.2X SSC and 0.05X SSC respectively.  The slides were dried by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 minutes and then scanned as described below.  Microarray Scanning and Data Analysis:  The slides were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The photomultiplier tube values (PMT) were adjusted to obtain equivalent intensities at both wavelengths used, 635 nm and 532 nm for the Cy5 and Cy3 channels respectively.

Based on reporter gene studies in glucose-starved yeast, it was proposed that translationally silenced eukaryotic mRNAs accumulate in P-bodies and can return to active translation. We present evidence contradicting the notion that this model is a widespread and general phenomenon. First, genome-wide measurements of mRNA abundance, translation, and ribosome occupancy following glucose withdrawal show that most mRNAs are lost from the cell coincident with their loss from polysomes. Second, only a very limited sub-population of translationally repressed transcripts, comprising fewer than 400 genes, can be reactivated for translation upon glucose re-addition in the absence of new transcription. This highly selective post-transcriptional regulation could be a mechanism for cells to minimize the energetic costs of reversing gene-regulatory decisions in rapidly changing environments by transiently preserving a pool of transcripts whose translation is rate-limiting for growth. Sigma 1278b yeast were grown to OD600=1.0-1.1 in YPD in baffled flasks at 30C with vigorous shaking.

Gene expression profiles of PBMCs have been shown to reflect the pathological and physiological state of a person. Recently, we showed that the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR?) has a functional role in human PBMCs during fasting. However, the extent of the role of PPAR? in human PBMCs remains unclear. In this study, we therefore performed gene expression profiling of PBMCs incubated with the specific PPAR? ligand WY14,643. Results: Incubation of PBMCs with WY14,643 for 12 hours resulted in a differential expression of 1,373 of the 13,080 genes expressed in the PBMCs. Gene expression profiles showed a clear individual response to PPAR? activation between six healthy human blood donors, which was not the result of the nutritional status of the donors. Pathway analysis showed that genes in fatty acid metabolism, primarily in ?-oxidation were up-regulated upon activation of PPAR? with WY14,643, and genes in several amino acid metabolism pathways were down-regulated. Conclusions: This study shows that PPAR? in human PBMCs regulates fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. In addition, PBMC gene expression profiles show individual responses to WY14,643 activation. We show that PBMCs are a suitable model to study changes in PPAR? activation in healthy humans.

Quantity and quality of total RNA was analyzed by the 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and agarose gel electrophoresis. • Labeling protocol(s):; The detailed protocol for the sample preparation and microarray processing is available from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 µg of purified total RNA was reverse transcribed by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) using T7-(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. After synthesis of the second complementary DNA (cDNA) strand, this product was used in an in vitro transcription reaction to generate biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA). • The protocol and conditions used during hybridization, blocking and washing:; Fifteen micrograms of fragmented, biotinylated cRNA were hybridized to a HG-U95Av2 microarray (Affymetrix Inc.) for 16 hours at 45° C with constant rotation at 60 rpm. This high-density oligonucleotide array targets 9,670 human genes as selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Bank database with a total of 12,000 oligonucleotide sets. Each microarray was used to assay a single sample. After hybridization, the microarray was washed and stained on an Affymetrix fluidics station and scanned with an argon-ion confocal laser, with a 488 nm emission and detection at 570 nm. • GeneChip image analysis was performed using the Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc.).

Microarray analyses identified multiple genes associated with copper and iron homeostasis and sulfur metabolism as significantly differentially expressed upon exposure to saxitoxin; these results were verified with quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the qRT-PCR assays were used to generate expression profiles in a subset of the differentially regulated genes across multiple exposure times and concentrations, the results of which demonstrated that overall, genes tended to respond in a consistent manner to the toxin. In general, the genes encoding the metallothioneins CUP1 and CRS5 were induced following exposure to saxitoxin, while those encoding the ferric/cupric reductase FRE1 and the copper uptake transporter CTR1 were repressed. The gene encoding the multicopper ferroxidase FET3, part of the high-affinity iron uptake system, was also induced in all treatments, along with the STR3 gene, which codes for the cystathionine beta-lyase found in the methionine biosynthetic pathway.

  DOCUMENT = %q({"documentId":"E-GEOD-38707","AE_description":"Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted via the bites of infected Anopheline mosquitoes. Midgut invasion is a major bottleneck for Plasmodium development inside the mosquito vectors as a rapidly responding immune system recognizes ookinetes and recruits killing factors from the midgut and surrounding tissues, dramatically reducing the population of invading ookinetes before they can successfully traverse the midgut epithelium. Understanding molecular details of the parasite-vector interactions requires precise measurement of nascent protein synthesis in the mosquito during Plasmodium infection. Current expression profiling primarily monitors alterations in steady-state levels of mRNA, but does not address the equally critical issue of whether the proteins encoded by the mRNAs are actually synthesized. In this study, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation to isolate actively translating Anopheles gambiae mRNAs based upon their association with polyribosomes (polysomes). The proportion of individual gene transcripts associated with polysomes, which is determined by RNA deep sequencing, reflects mRNA translational status. This approach led to identification of 1017 mosquito transcripts that were primarily regulated at the translational level after ingestion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood. Caspar, a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB transcription factor Rel2, appears to be substantially activated at the translational levels during Plasmodium infection. In addition, transcripts of Dcr1, Dcr2 and Drosha, which are involved in small RNA biosynthesis, exhibited enhanced associations with polysomes after P. falciparum challenge. This observation suggests that mosquito microRNAs may play an important role in reactions against Plasmodium invasion. We analyzed both total cellular mRNAs and mRNAs that are associated with polysomes to simultaneously monitor transcriptomes and nascent protein synthesis in the mosquito. This approach provides more accurate information regarding the rate of protein synthesis, and identifies some mosquito factors that might have gone unrecognized because expression of these proteins is regulated mainly at the translational level rather than at the transcriptional level after mosquitoes ingest a Plasmodium-infected blood meal. Midguts from female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were dissected at around 24 h after ingestion of P. falciparum-infected blood. Mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood were used as control. A portion of the midguts were used for isolation of total cellular RNA. Extracts of the remaining midguts were fractionated over sucrose density gradients, and fifteen fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. Non-polysomal fractions, as well as polysomal fractions were combined, respectively, to obtain two RNA pools per gradient for three independent experiments. The first, last and the sample between non-polysomal and polysomal, were all discarded to ensure pure pools from each set. A fourth experiment was conducted where the polysomal and non-polysomal samples were not pooled, to be used later for qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels of individual mosquito genes in polysome (PS) fractions, nonpolysome (NP) fractions and unfractionated steady-state (total) RNA were determined using high throughput RNA deep sequencing. Each RNA pool generated 2.1-9.8 million raw read .  Signal intensities of transcripts from each PS pool were compared to those of transcripts from a matching NP pool. To quantify the translational status of individual mRNA species, we define the relative PS loading [PL=P/(P+NP)] as the extent of mRNA association with polysomes. PL values were compared between the mosquitoes fed on P. falciparum-infected or -uninfected blood.","AE_experiment_type":"EFO\u001fhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0003738","AE_species":"NCBITAXON\u001fhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_7165","AE_name":"Translational regulation of Anopheles gambiae mRNAs in the midgut during Plasmodium falciparum infection"})
